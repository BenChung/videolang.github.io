This version requires <a href=\"https://www.mltframework.org/\">MLT</a> which is not included. You can find it on the <a href=\"http://lang.video/download.html\">download page</a>. Alpha builds of v0.2 are nearly ready. The major update with this version is the removal of MLT as a dependency. Instead, Video will rely entirely on <a href=\"http://ffmpeg.org/\">FFmpeg</a>, which will also be pre-bundled with the Mac and Windows builds of Video.
